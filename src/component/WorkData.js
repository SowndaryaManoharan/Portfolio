Through a combination of data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling, we aspire to equip the bank with the tools necessary to assess risk, streamline lending processes, and extend financial opportunities to eligible customers. The ultimate goal of the analysis is to gain insights and understand patterns within the data that can aid in predicting whether a customer is eligible to take a loan or not.",
